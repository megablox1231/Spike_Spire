(Should've just taken the stairs...)
Oh hey, when did you get here?
I'm trying to get to the top of this place as a sort of capstone to my trip. Some helpful people pointed me to the elevators, but I think I misunderstood their instructions and crashed the cabin. (So embarrasing)
I should go tell them what happened, you can go on ahead. Hopefully, next time we meet, it'll be at eye level.
