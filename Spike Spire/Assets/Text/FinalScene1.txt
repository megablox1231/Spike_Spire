Finally, something worth taking in this godforsaken land!
Take? Do you have any idea what you're looking at?
Oh, hello! Didn't see you there. (Must be one of the locals the traveller from earlier was talking about)
Uh, well you see, I'm an archeologist and I've been sent here and an important preservation mission.
Yea well, last time I checked this isn't some long dead civilization, I kind of still live here.
Just you nine in this entire structure? This place is practically empty. (Speaking of, I still may be able to grab that relic if I'm quick...)
Empty? Buddy, there's millions of us here!
Holy shit the floor can talk!
