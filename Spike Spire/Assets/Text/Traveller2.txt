Hey, ... up here!
It's me, the puddle from before! I seem to have gotten myself into trouble again.
I found the key to get through the door to the right, but trapped myself here in the process.
I'd greatly appreciate it if you could find someone to help get me out of here. The view's actually quite nice from up here, but I'd like to move on.
