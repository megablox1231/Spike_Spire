Hello, ... down here!
Always nice to meet a fellow traveller. Sorry you have to see me like this, I'm normally much more composed.
Like you, I was busy enjoying the incredible sights here when my foot got caught on the terrain here. Seems like you can't walk or jump on it, so best to just avoid it.
I think I'm gonna be stuck here for a while, so you can go on ahead. I'm sure one of the locals will help me out eventually. Just gotta figure out how to get their attention.
