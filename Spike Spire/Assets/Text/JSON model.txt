    text s = Hello, ... down here!

    character s = Puddle
    text s = Always nice to meet a fellow traveller. Sorry you have to see me like this, I'm normally much more composed.
  dialogTexts[2]
    character s = Puddle
    text s = Like you, I was busy enjoying the incredible sights here when my foot got caught on the terrain here. Seems like you can't walk or jump on it, so best to just avoid it.
  dialogTexts[3]
    character s = Puddle
    text s = I think I'm gonna be stuck here for a while, so you can go on ahead. I'm sure one of the locals will help me out eventually. Just gotta figure out how to get their attention.

    text s = Hey, ... up here!
  dialogTexts[1]
    character s = Traveller
    text s = It's me, the puddle from before! I seem to have gotten myself into trouble again.
  dialogTexts[2]
    character s = Traveller
    text s = I found the key to get through the door to the right, but trapped myself here in the process.
  dialogTexts[3]
    character s = Traveller
    text s = I'd greatly appreciate it if you could find someone to help get me out of here. The view's actually quite nice from up here, but I'd like to move on.

    character s = Puddle
    text s = Well, uh thanks for getting me out. I think the key landed somewhere around here.
  dialogTexts[1]
    character s = Puddle
    text s = Its gonna take me a few minutes to reform myself so you should take it and go on ahead. I don't want to slow you down. (The view isn't half bad here either)

    character s = Traveller
    text s = Felt like this whole thing was gonna come down. Maybe I pressed the wrong combination?

  dialogTexts[1]
    character s = Puddle
    text s = Oh hey, when did you get here?
  dialogTexts[2]
    character s = Puddle
    text s = I'm trying to get to the top of this place as a sort of capstone to my trip. Some helpful people pointed me to the elevators, but I think I misunderstood their instructions and crashed the cabin. (So embarrasing)
  dialogTexts[3]
    character s = Puddle
    text s = I should go tell them what happened, you can go on ahead. Hopefully, next time we meet, it'll be at eye level.

    text s = Finally, something worth taking in this godforsaken land!
  dialogTexts[1]
    character s = StandingTri
    text s = Take? Do you have any idea what you're looking at?
  dialogTexts[2]
    character s = TreasureHunter
    text s = Oh, hello! Didn't see you there. (Must be one of the locals the traveller from earlier was talking about)
  dialogTexts[3]
    character s = TreasureHunter
    text s = Uh, well you see, I'm an archeologist and I've been sent here and an important preservation mission.
  dialogTexts[4]
    character s = StandingTri
    text s = Yea well, last time I checked this isn't some long dead civilization, I kind of still live here.
  dialogTexts[5]
    character s = TreasureHunter
    text s = Just you nine in this entire structure? This place is practically empty. (Speaking of, I still may be able to grab that relic if I'm quick...)
  dialogTexts[6]
    character s = FloorTri
    text s = Empty? Buddy, there's millions of us here!
  dialogTexts[6]
    character s = TreasureHunter
    text s = Holy shit the floor can talk!

  dialogTexts[1]
    character s = Traveller
    text s = Oh, hey! Looks like you couldn't resist the fantastic view up here either!
  dialogTexts[2]
    character s = TreasureHunter
    text s = Dude, ... the floors are alive.
  dialogTexts[3]
    character s = Traveller
    text s = The walls, too. Though they didn't start talking until after that first fall I took which might be concerning.
  dialogTexts[4]
    character s = FloorTri
    text s = We don't have much interest in talking to a couple of tourists who sneak in through the back. Next time go through the front and we may be more friendly.
  dialogTexts[5]
    character s = StandingTri
    text s = Well, back to the topic on hand. This here is one of our most prized possessions, a primordial relic given to us by the divine itself.
  dialogTexts[6]
    character s = Traveller
    text s = Wow, didn't know you had an interest in history too traveler! (I also thought you were mute this entire time too)
  dialogTexts[7]
    character s = TreasureHunter
    text s = Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh
  dialogTexts[8]
    character s = Traveller
    text s = Oh, I have just the thing for you too! There's a souvenir shop on the floor just below us with replicas of that statue, I'm sure you'd love to take one home.

    character s = TreasureHunter
    text s = I
  dialogTexts[10]
    character s = StandingTri
    text s = Yes, that sounds like a great idea! Maybe pick up some of our specialty triangle ice cream while you're at it. Learn about the area and have a little fun.

    character s = TreasureHunter
    text s = Y-Yea... sounds good. (I think I need a new job)
