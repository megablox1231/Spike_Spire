Bounds of player boxCollider2D interpolates between .5 and .50000000001 constantly
When respawing, if left or right pressed at specific time, player teleports to the wall
because player collider moves a bit when changing direction, player can phase through walls -- see demo_3 last level
Add short pause when respawning
Forward Slash not recognizing it is touching brittle spike block layer when paired with obstacle layer
isTouchingLayers For SwordJump now inaccurate
Camera might not play nice with non rectangular shapes
1st cam boundry trigger can screw with collisions and transitions between levels (happens often in full build), dying once fixes this
Transitions occur on unscaled time so pausing does not pause them
Pause Menu buttons not working in build
One way platforms have skinny colliders to try to prevent standing on bottom, but still possible
restarting game from menu in parallax section causes parallax to be off
