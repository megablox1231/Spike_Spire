Bounds of player boxCollider2D interpolates between .5 and .50000000001 constantly
When respawing, if left or right pressed at specific time, player teleports to the wall
Fix Blockers
Correctly synchronise spikes
changed tag of playerCollider from nothing to "Player"
fix shitty colliders on elongating spikes that dont work half the time (probably manually stop at inputted certain locale without colliders and when brittle spikes are gone, go full length)
Spawnpoint prefab changes when going through levels automatically
Add short pause when respawning
Forward Slash not recognizing it is touching brittle spike block layer when paired with obstacle layer
isTouchingLayers For SwordJump now inaccurate
Camera might not play nice with non rectangular shapes
